# AuctionSystem

It is designed to work with socket usage for network programming.

By using Socket io, users can simultaneously view the auctions shared by another user, place a price offer and see instant price changes.

The item is automatically removed from the auction 2 minutes after it is shared.

In this system, a user can register to the system, log in, start a new auction, view the auctions currently in progress, and place a bid.

It is a simple socket application developed to experience socket programming and network protocols.
